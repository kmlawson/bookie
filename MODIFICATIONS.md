# Modifications Made to Bookie for My Own Purposes

- changed bookie.ts to include an option to search. 2021.9.5


## Notes

- Building didn't seem to include Webpack and thus the binary data wasn't 
included after any rebuild. But using `npx weback watch` and then `yarn 
serve` rebuilt everything nicely.
